# Why I chose the technologies and what did I gain from it?
With a passion for data and arriving conclusions I have always wanted to gain more experience with different technologies as I grow. This particular project could have been done with an excel sheet but I wanted to apply some of the knowledge I have picked up through codeacademy to an analysis. The technologies I chose were Python and SQL. Python is great for collection of data using the bs4 package so I applied that and was able to loop through a series of names and different link ids to get the span of time the player played in the nba. I then took that data and stored it in SQL so it could be easily queried from juypter notebook. Within python I was able to utilize the queries in SQL to my advantage when performing data manipulation. This made it seamless to create different visualizations. 
From this experience I gained a lot of knowledge about working through a clean notebook. I also picked up man data engineering skills while working with different structures to make the analysis smooth. This also helped me refresh on some familiar topics such as matplotlib, pandas and seaborn. In this analysis I used new visualizations to explore the data. 

 ## Project ?
 The goal of this project was to get a deep understanding of each players statistics over the course of their career. This project takes deep dives into players performance over the years and how they stack up agaisnt eachother. 
 
 ## The Question
 # Who is the greatest player?
